# Spectrangle

This project concerns an implementation of a board game called Spectrangle in Java. Spectrangle is a triangular tile based abstract strategy game. The game can have between 1 and 4 players and it takes a playing time of about 45 minutes. The triangular tiles, also called trangs, come double sided with a permutation of colors consisting red, yellow, green, cyan, and magenta. In addition, the tiles consist of a Joker with white colors on all its sides. Furthermore, each tile comes with a number that indicates its value with respect to other tiles. The board itself contains marked locations that will grant a player bonus point. The game consists of 36 tiles, a board and a scoring mechanism for each player.

The game is implemented by using the principles of object oriented programming knowledge acquired during module 2 - software systems. In this implementation, mirroring of the tiles (trangs) is neglected.

The implementation makes use of a client/server functionality and allows one to play the board game of Spectrangle as a singleplayer, multiplayer or against an artificial intelligence.

Note for correctors: /out folder contains compiled .class files, which can be used to play the game without compiling it yourself using java from command line.


# Getting Started

In order to play the game simply download the zip file and run CliantMain.java. Further information can be found in the JavaDocs of the classes.
