# Spectrangle

This project concerns an implementation of a board game called Spectrangle in Java. Spectrangle is a triangular tile based abstract strategy game. The game can have between 1 and 4 players and it takes a playing time of about 45 minutes. The triangular tiles, also called trangs, come double sided with a permutation of colors consisting red, yellow, green, cyan, and magenta. In addition, the tiles consist of a Joker with white colors on all its sides. Furthermore, each tile comes with a number that indicates its value with respect to other tiles. The board itself contains marked locations that will grant a player bonus point. The game consists of 36 tiles, a board and a scoring mechanism for each player.

In this implementation, mirroring of the tiles (trangs) is neglected.

The implementation makes use of a client/server functionality and allows one to play the board game of Spectrangle as a singleplayer, multiplayer or against an artificial intelligence.

Please read Documentation.pdf for more information on the design process, and the structure of this repository.


# Getting Started

In order to play the game simply download the zip file and run CliantMain.java. Further information can be found in the JavaDocs of the classes.

# Prerequisites

This is a program written in Java, and thus requires the latest Java Runtime Environment (JDE)
